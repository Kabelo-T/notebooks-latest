    "This tutorial will cover the basics of using the spectroscopic production database, which is loaded from the outputs of the DESI pipeline.  Currently, this is based on software \"release\" `23.1`, and uses a [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) database. We use [SQLAlchemy](http://www.sqlalchemy.org/) to abstract away the details of the database.\n",

    "[q3c](https://github.com/segasai/q3c) ([Koposov & Bartunov 2006](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2006ASPC..351..735K/abstract)) is a popular library that provides spatial indexing and searching in astronomical databases. Here we'll demonstrate how to access this functionality in SQLAlchemy.  Any database function is accessible with `sqlalchemy.sql.func`.  This is a radial (\"cone\") search on an arbitrary point in the DESI footprint:\n",
