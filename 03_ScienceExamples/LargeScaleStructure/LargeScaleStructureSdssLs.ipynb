    "\n",
    "In this Notebook, we explore large-scale structures of galaxies by combining spectroscopic redshifts from SDSS/BOSS with photometry from the DESI pre-imaging Legacy Survey (LS). The advantage of spectroscopic redshifts is that they are far more accurate than photometric redshifts to probe distances to galaxies (though still need to be corrected for possible distortion effects such as the finger-of-God effect, which we ignore here). The advantage of the LS photometry is that it reaches deeper than SDSS by about 1 magnitude, which yields better image quality to measure magnitudes, colors, and galaxy shapes. While there are several possible extensions to the example work included below, we will show that a simple figure of galaxy spatial locations color-coded by galaxy morphological type reveals the known morphology-density relation.\n",
    "\n",
    "We wanted to extend indeed a little further and be able to visualize and even interact with a representation of these galaxies in the actual space. For that, we developed a 3D plot based directly (as a flat cube, without any projection or correction) on RA, DEC and z, and that is at the end of this NB.\n",
    "\n",
    "On a technical point of view, this short notebook illustrates an example joint query between the LS DR3 photometry Tractor table, and the SDSS/BOSS DR13 specObj spectroscopy table. It takes advantage of the fact that there is a version of the LS DR3 tractor table that was pre-matched to SDSS/BOSS DR13 so we can join on a common column called **specobjid**.\n",
