    "# Summary\n",
    "Our own galaxy, the Milky Way (MW), provides detailed views of astrophysical processes, anchoring much of our understanding about galaxy formation and evolution. However, because we are observing the MW while residing in it, our observations suffer from complications arising from line-of-sight reddening, uncertain distances, and background/foreground confusion. Studying external galaxies instead, which are free of these projection effects, offers a much cleaner view of an entire galaxy. The closest massive galaxy to the MW, the Andromeda galaxy (also known as M31) provides a superb laboratory, as its proximity still allows us to resolve its individual stars but is far enough away to observe the entire galaxy. Furthermore, M31 contains a wide range of local environments consisting of young and old stellar populations. It also has various structures including spiral arms, star-forming rings, a bar, and a bulge. \n",
